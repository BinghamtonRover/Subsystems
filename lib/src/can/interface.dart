/// This class uses the [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) protocol to interface with
/// other devices on the CAN bus. Each message should have an ID and a payload. The ID is used to 
/// identify the purpose of the message, and the receiving device can filter incoming messages
/// based on its ID. The payload is limited to 8 bytes, or 64 bytes if using CAN FD.
/// 
/// - Use [sendMessage] to send a message to all devices on the bus
/// - Listen to [incomingMessages] to receive messages from other devices on the bus
